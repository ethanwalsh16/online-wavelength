## Online Wavelength

Modelled after the popular board game wavelength, this game tests the psychic connection between its players.

Player 1 will select a random number on the slider between 1 and 100, with each end of the spectrum being assigned one side of a this-or-that style question (hot or cold).

Player 1 will then offer a clue to Player 2 (e.g. if the slider was at 1, where the hottest things are, they would say "The Sun").

Player 2 will enter their guess, and the team will receive points based on how close their two set points were.
